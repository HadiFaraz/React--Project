# TriviaTrek - A React Quiz App

![Overview](src/Walkthrough.gif)

## Summary:
🚀 "TriviaTrek" represents my inaugural solo project in React, an interactive quiz application that has been both a learning journey and a delightful coding adventure. Here's a glance at what I've gleaned from this exciting endeavor:

## Key Learnings:
🧠 React Fundamentals: This was a journey into React's core concepts, including components, props, state management, and hooks, expanding my development toolkit.

🌐 API Integration: I harnessed the power of external APIs, fetching and processing data to dynamically populate quiz questions and answers.

🔄 Data Transformation: I honed my skills in data transformation and structuring, from randomizing answer options to ensuring a seamless user experience.

🖼️ Conditional Rendering: I learned to craft intuitive user interfaces through conditional rendering, adapting the app's display based on user interactions.

🛠️ Error Handling: I elevated user experience by implementing robust error-handling techniques, ensuring responses to potential fetch errors.

## Key Technologies and Features:
⚛️ React: I harnessed the power of React, sculpting a dynamic and responsive single-page application that's both functional and visually appealing.

📚 Open Trivia Database API: The app draws its lifeblood from the Open Trivia Database API, enriching the experience with a wealth of quiz questions and answers.

🔍 He.js: I employed the "he" library to decode HTML entities, ensuring that fetched data is presented in a reader-friendly format.

🧩 Component-Based Architecture: The app's structure boasts reusable components, fostering code organization and facilitating future maintenance.

🌈 Conditional Styling: My skills evolved as I wielded CSS to dynamically style selected answers and distinguish correct from incorrect choices.

🧬 State Management: Leveraging React state, I skillfully managed user interactions, from tracking selected answers to orchestrating the app's display modes.
